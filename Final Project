-- Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
    -- It is impossible to answer this question without using correlation function that is not supported on Coursera. The standard deviation and root square functions are also unavailable, therefore it is not possible to do manual correlation here. However, looking at the returned data below, there is possibility that review count and fans are not significantly correlated as we can see the inconsistency between the average of review count and fans.

    -- Difference 2: the ones that are open received more reviews (possibly more popular) compared to the closed ones



-- For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
-- Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
    -- Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
        -- Most popular categories on Yelp in the past 7 days (from August 9, 2022)
    -- Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        -- I want to know what categories are the most popular on Yelp in these past 7 days. The data that I need is total number of review and date from review table; and category from category table.
        -- By substracting current date and the review date, we can get the latest number of review based on the categories. I also want to add the average of stars rating to give a brief information on how users perceived these categories.
